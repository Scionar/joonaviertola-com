# About

Front-end focused developer with praised organizing skills.

I have **8 years professional experience of front-end development** with different size projects on multiple industries. In some projects Iâ€™ve been from the start and on some Iâ€™ve joined in the middle. This has given me experience on surviving in different situations and getting into projects really fast. ðŸš€

**Design systems are my favorite projects**. Going deep into UX and accessibility with both developer and designer experience in mind, is a never ending learning process of cutting the perfect diamond. ðŸ’Ž

In projects Iâ€™ve been responsible for both, a separate front-end app which communicates with an API or headless CMS. Always interested in keeping things simple and finding new stable tools to make work even more reliable.
