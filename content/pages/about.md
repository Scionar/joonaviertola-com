# About

This website is meant to be a collection of my notes of complex subjects. It's easier to check out my own notes from here, forward it to my co-workers and advertise my knowledge.

I'm passionate website developer focused to JavaScript and NodeJS development. Last four years in business, I've been focusing into front-end development, but occasionally also been diving into fullstack working.

I'm located at [Finland](https://www.google.fi/maps/place/Suomi/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4681cadf4b32f6dd:0x146d63c75a810?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjo3-n75vnWAhWJYpoKHS-HDrgQ8gEIIzAA)'s capital [Helsinki](https://www.google.fi/maps/place/Helsinki/@60.1098664,24.7378275,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x4681cadf4b32f6dd:0x146d63c75a810!2sSuomi!3b1!8m2!3d61.92411!4d25.7481511!3m4!1s0x46920bc796210691:0xcd4ebd843be2f763!8m2!3d60.1688416!4d24.9389648).
