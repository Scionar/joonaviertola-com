# About

Front-end focused developer with praised organizing skills.

I have **8 years professional experience of front-end development** with different size projects on multiple industries. In some projects I’ve been from the start and on some I’ve joined in the middle. This has given me experience on surviving in different situations and getting into projects really fast. 🚀

**Design systems are my favorite projects**. Going deep into UX and accessibility with both developer and designer experience in mind, is a never ending learning process of cutting the perfect diamond. 💎

In projects I’ve been responsible for both, a separate front-end app which communicates with an API or headless CMS. Always interested in keeping things simple and finding new stable tools to make work even more reliable.
