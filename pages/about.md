# About

This website is meant to be a collection of my notes of complex subjects. It's easier to check out my own notes from here, forward it to my co-workers and advertise my knowledge.

## Who

I'm passionate website developer focused to JavaScript and NodeJS development. Last four years in business, I've been focusing into front-end development, but occasionally also been diving into fullstack working.
